        The knight rode deep into the shadowed woods, the hooves of his steed muffled by damp earth and fallen leaves.  
        Twisted trees leaned inward as if whispering warnings, their gnarled branches shifting ever so slightly.  
        It was as though the forest itself were alive, watching his every move in eerie silence.  
        Strange symbols etched into stone marked the path ahead â€” the presence of the evil king was near.
