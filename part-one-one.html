                    The knight tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword, heart pounding with purpose.  
                    The fate of the kingdom rested on his shoulders, and he would not let it fall.  
                    With courage in his chest and the road ahead uncertain, he gave a resolute nod.  
                    The quest had begun.
