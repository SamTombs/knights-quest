                <p class="para">You decide to keep your helmet on as the trail winds higher through the cliffs.  
                    A sudden crack echoes as a small rock tumbles from above, striking the top of your helmet with a sharp clang.  
                    The blow startles you but leaves no painâ€”your armor did its job.  
                    You grip the reins tighter, more alert now to the dangers hidden in the pass.
