🏰 Knights Quest
Knights Quest is a pixel-art, choose-your-own-adventure web game where you play as a knight on a quest to rescue a kidnapped magical cat from an evil king. 
Explore forests, towns, and dungeons while making impactful choices that shape your story.

I chose this game, as it reminded me off my favourite books as a child. This is a good choice for me for my first project as I can show a bit of creativity, put it some solid but not too heavy code
and show my attention to detail, replicating/altering code over different HTML pages.
