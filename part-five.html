                <p class="para">The knight rides cautiously through the rugged mountain pass, loose rocks shifting beneath his horse’s hooves.  
                    The sun blazes overhead, turning his armor into a furnace and drawing sweat down his face.  
                    Each step forward feels heavier, the path unforgiving and steep, but he doesn’t slow.  
                    Beyond these cliffs lies his mission—he cannot afford to turn back.
